The record containing the recipe information is as follows:

The Record:

  * Make questions about specific ingredients used in the recipe.
  * Make questions about specific steps to make the recipe.
  * Make questions about specific tips for the recipe such as cooking times, difficulty, cold dish, hot dish, etc
  * The questions should include the name of the recipe or the type of meal to be more specific.
- "The Record" should contain the answer to the generated questions.
- The questions should be complete and not too short.
- Use as fewer words as possible from the record.
- Don't generate the answers to the questions.


Given the previous instructions, the output format must meet the restrictions:

- Provide the result in parsable JSON format without using code blocks.
- Do not generate solutions with additional text or json-style comments.
- Make sure the JSON is well-formed and has closing braces and brackets.
- The 5 questions form an array of questions.
- The questions end with the question character and must be enclosed in double quotes.

Please follow the following format strictly:

{{
  "questions": ["question1", "question2", ..., "question5"]
}}
